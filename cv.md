## About me
I started my journey in programming at school, when I decided to take an exam in computer science. Then I learned my first programming language - Pascal :)

After school, I entered the university to major in computer security, where I became familiar with the internal structure of a computer, and also learned the C language well, and subsequently Object Oriented Programming and C++.

Now I want to study the profession of Frontend Development and I hope that I will like it.
## Skills
* C, C++, Python languages
*  HTML, Css, JS(few)
## Experience
```
function sentence(List) {
  // your code
  List.sort();
  for(let i = -999; i < List.length; i++){
    if(List[i])
      console.log(List.);
  }
}
```
## Education
I studied 3.5 courses at the university in the direction of Computer Security.
Also passed stage 0, but unfortunately did not reach the very end.
